# Ruby Shift
Basic command line program for switching between different versions of Ruby in Windows.




# Not pretty, but functional. 


This does not setup the environment for you. I will change that in future commits. You will have to install different versions of ruby yourself and keep them in "C:\rubies". You will also have to set environment variables in PATH for "R:\" AND "R:\bin"...make sure you remove any Ruby folders that are already listed in PATH.
