# Ruby Shift
Basic command line program for switching between different versions of Ruby in Windows.




# Not pretty, but functional. 


This does not setup the environment for you. I will change that in future commits. You will have to install different versions of ruby yourself and keep them in "C:\rubies". You will also have to set environment variables in PATH for "R:\" AND "R:\bin"...make sure that you remove any Ruby folders that are already listed in PATH.


This program changes where R:\ is mapped to, based on user input. It lists versions of Ruby which are located in the rubies folder and allows you choose which you would like to use.
